The Figure 4 app gives people suffering from epilepsy a chance to log all of their seizures which can be used during Doctor visits to help treat their seizures.  After an event is posted, the user can either make it public or private.  Public events will allow other users to comment and like the event.  Users can make events private at any time.  There is also a medication list that will help epileptic patients remember what kind of seizure medications they are taking.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB

I used Bootstrap to have everything look nice and responsive.  EJS was used as the templating language and for the back end I used Node and Express connected to MongoDB.

## Future updates:

<li>
  <ul>Add map to nearest hospital</ul>
</li>

## Lessons Learned:

Sometimes you might take hours trying to loop over something when the easiest solution was to change the model.
